    <p class="in20">The 3-in-1 Spider Cycle is a small Spider-Man playset which features a built-in Nerf blaster. It is based on the Spider-Cycle driven by Spider-Man. The motorcycle can be changed into three different forms; these do not affect the blaster portion of the toy.</p>

    <p class="in21">Rather than featuring a standard firing trigger, there is instead a firing button located on top of the motorcycle, behind the driver's seat. A plunger rod sticks out from the rear of the toy.</p>

      <p class="in22">It advertises a firing range of up to twenty feet (six meters).</p>
